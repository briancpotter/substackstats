# Email Subscriber Analysis Script

This script analyzes email Substack subscriber data from a CSV file and generates a comprehensive report including subscription age distribution, open rates, and detailed breakdowns by domain categories (educational institutions, Fortune 100 companies, government agencies, media outlets, and philanthropic organizations). It provides insights into subscriber engagement patterns over time and identifies key subscriber segments.

To run the script, first download your Substack email list (check "export all columns" when downloading), then rename the file `full_email.csv` . Save this script to the same directory, then execute `python email_subscriber_analysis.py`.  It will generate a detailed analysis report saved to `email_analysis_report.txt`.
